# Rearrange Array: Move Middle Half to Front

This C++ program rearranges a given array such that the second and third quarters are moved to the front, while the first and fourth quarters are moved to the end.

## Example

Input:  {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}  
Output: {3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 7, 8}

## Notes

- If the array size isn't divisible by 4, the extra elements go into the middle section.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
