# Remove Common Elements from Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem
Given two sorted arrays of integers, merge them into a single sorted array that:
- Includes only the elements that are **not common** between the two arrays.
- Is sorted in ascending order.

## Example
Input:
- array1 = {2, 5, 7, 10}
- array2 = {1, 5, 9}

Output:
- {1, 2, 7, 9, 10}

## Time and Space Complexity
- Time: O(n + m) where n and m are the sizes of the two input arrays.
- Space: O(n + m) for the result array.
