# Count Even and Odd Integers in a Vector

This solution implements a C++ function that returns the count of even and odd integers from a given vector of integers, using only basic C++ constructs and no built-in STL algorithms like `std::count_if`.

### Function Signature

```cpp
std::pair<int, int> countEvenOdd(const std::vector<int>& nums);
