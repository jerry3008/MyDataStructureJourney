# My Data Structure Journey ğŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository where I solve and document data structure and algorithm problems regularly as part of my path to becoming a skilled Software Engineer.

---

## Goals

- Sharpen my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.
- Master fundamental data structures (arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, etc.).
- Improve coding speed and accuracy for technical interviews.
- Push consistent progress to GitHub to track growth.

##  Solved Problems

### Performance Optimization with Unordered Maps in C++
> Explore how unordered maps improve runtime for specific problem types.

### string_problems

#### ğŸ”¹ Problem: Maximum Word Break by Character Removal
- **Description:**  
  Given a string (up to 500 ASCII characters), find the character whose removal breaks the most unique words.
- **Example:**  
  Input: `"Hello, world!"` â†’ Output: `('l', 2)`
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Status:**  Solved

## Upcoming Topics

- Arrays
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms

---

## Language

- Primarily C++
- Occasional Python for prototyping

---

## Commit Habit

> I commit at least one solved problem or notebook update each day to stay consistent and build accountability.
