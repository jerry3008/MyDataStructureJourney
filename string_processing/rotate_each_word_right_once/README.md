# Rotate Each Word Right by One

## Task
Given a string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000), split it by single spaces into words, rotate the characters of **each word** one step to the right (last char moves to front), then join the words back with single spaces. Return the final string.

## Constraints
- The input string does not start/end with a space and has no consecutive spaces.
- Each word consists only of letters and digits, length ∈ [1, 10].
- Case-sensitive.

## Example
Input: `"abc 123 def"`  
Output: `"cab 312 fde"`
