# Reverse Alphabet Mapping and Reorder Words

## Task
Given a string of words separated by whitespace:
1. Replace each character with its corresponding opposite letter in the English alphabet:
   - Lowercase: a ↔ z, b ↔ y, ..., m ↔ n
   - Uppercase: A ↔ Z, B ↔ Y, ..., M ↔ N
2. Preserve the case of each letter.
3. After transformation, reorder the string so that the **last word** comes first, followed by the remaining words in their original order.

## Constraints
- 1 ≤ number of words ≤ 100
- Words contain only `[a-zA-Z]`
- No leading/trailing spaces and no consecutive spaces

## Example
**Input:**
