# Common Ordered Characters from Two Strings

This program builds a new string from characters that appear in both input strings. The characters must appear in the order of the first string, and each character is added only as many times as it appears in both strings.

## Example
Input:
  string1 = "apple"
  string2 = "peach"

Output:
  "ape"

## Complexity
Time: O(n + m)
Space: O(m) for frequency map
