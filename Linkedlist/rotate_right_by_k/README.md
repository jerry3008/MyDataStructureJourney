# Rotate Linked List to the Right by K Places

Write a function `ListNode* rotateRight(ListNode* head, int k)` that rotates the linked list to the right by `k` places. The last `k` elements should become the first `k` elements in the list.

Example:  
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, k = 2  
Output: 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3

Time Complexity: O(n)
