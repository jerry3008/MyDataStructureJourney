# Secondary Diagonal Min-Max Finder

This program computes the minimum and maximum values on the secondary diagonal of a given square matrix.

### Problem Statement

Given a square matrix `grid` of integers, the goal is to find the minimum and maximum values located on the secondary diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left corner).

- If the matrix is empty or not square, return `{-1, -1}`.
- Time complexity must be **O(n)**.
