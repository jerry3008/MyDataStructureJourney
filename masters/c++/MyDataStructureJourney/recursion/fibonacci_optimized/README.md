# Optimized Recursive Fibonacci (O(n))

This program calculates the n-th Fibonacci number using recursion and memoization for O(n) time complexity.

## Problem

Given an integer `n`, return the `n`-th number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion only.

## Constraints

- Must use recursion (no loops or iteration)
- Must use memoization to avoid repeated calculations (O(n) time)
