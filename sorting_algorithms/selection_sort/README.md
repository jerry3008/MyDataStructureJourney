# Selection Sort

This implementation sorts an array using the Selection Sort algorithm.

## Description

Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.

## Example

**Input:**  
[3, 1, 2, 4, 5]

**Output:**  
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

## Time Complexity

Worst-case: O(n^2)  
Space Complexity: O(1)
